# Travelling-Salesman-Problem-Solve-with-Genetic-Algorithm-with-ROS-ANd-c-LANGUAGE
In the traveling salesman problem, it aims to find the shortest route or the least costly tour that passes
through each of the cities with known distances only once. Although it is easy to define the traveling salesman problem, 
it is very difficult to obtain the optimal solution and it is among the NP-difficult (Non polynomial-hard) problems in the literature.
This makes it impossible, so different methods have been proposed that can solve the problem in a short time. One of these methods is genetic algorithms.
